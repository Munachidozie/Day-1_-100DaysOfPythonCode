print('''My name is Munachi
Today is 12th of January 2022
I am signing up for Replit's 100 days of Python challenge
I will make sure to spend some time everyday coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!
I can say I feel ready 😮‍💨
